## 📜 What Is This?

**AI Court** is a ready-to-use multi-AI-agent collaboration system that maps China's ancient **Three Departments and Six Ministries** (中书省 Zhongshu · 门下省 Menxia · 尚书省 Shangshu → 吏部 Personnel · 户部 Revenue · 礼部 Rites · 兵部 War · 刑部 Justice · 工部 Works) onto a modern AI agent organization.

**In plain terms:** You are the Emperor 👑, and AI agents are your ministers. Each minister has a clear role — one writes code, one manages finances, one handles marketing, one runs DevOps — all you do is issue an "imperial decree" (@mention an agent in Discord), and they execute immediately.

### 🤔 Why an Ancient Court Architecture?

The Three Departments and Six Ministries system was one of the longest-running organizational frameworks in human history (Sui/Tang to Qing dynasty, over 1,300 years). Its core design principles:

- **🏛️ Clear Separation of Duties** — Each ministry handles its own domain, no overstepping (= each AI Agent has its specialty)
- **📋 Standardized Processes** — Memorial submission and imperial review systems (= Prompt templates + SOUL.md persona injection)
- **🔄 Checks and Balances** — Three Departments cross-verify (= Agent cross-review, multi-step confirmation)
- **📜 Record Keeping** — Court diaries and historical records (= Memory persistence, Notion auto-archival)

These concepts map perfectly to modern multi-agent system design needs. **Ancient governance wisdom is the best practice for modern AI team management.**

### 🎯 Core Capabilities at a Glance

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🤖 **Multi-Agent Collaboration** | 7 independent AI Agents (Six Ministries + Chief Steward), each specialized, working in concert |
| 🧠 **Independent Memory** | Each agent has its own workspace and memory files — the more you use it, the better it knows you |
| 🛠️ **60+ Built-in Skills** | GitHub, Notion, Browser, Cron, TTS and more, ready out of the box |
| ⏰ **Automated Tasks** | Cron scheduling + heartbeat self-checks, 24/7 unattended operation |
| 🔒 **Sandbox Isolation** | Docker container isolation, agent code runs independently |
| 💬 **Native Discord** | Works on phone & desktop, @mention to invoke, zero learning curve |
| 🖥️ **Web Dashboard** | React + TypeScript dashboard for visual management |
| 🌐 **OpenClaw Ecosystem** | Built on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclawai/openclaw), access the [OpenClaw Hub](https://github.com/openclawai/openclaw) Skill ecosystem |

### 🏢 Prefer a Corporate Edition?

If you're more familiar with modern corporate management concepts, we have an **English corporate version**:

👉 **[Become CEO](https://github.com/wanikua/become-ceo)** — Same architecture, using CEO / CTO / CFO / CMO roles instead of imperial ministries

| 🏛️ Court Role | 🏢 Corporate Role | Responsibility |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Emperor 👑 | CEO | Ultimate decision maker |
| 司礼监 Chief Steward | COO | Daily coordination, task delegation |
| 兵部 War Ministry | CTO / VP Engineering | Software engineering, architecture |
| 户部 Revenue Ministry | CFO / VP Finance | Financial analysis, cost management |
| 礼部 Rites Ministry | CMO / VP Marketing | Brand marketing, content strategy |
| 工部 Works Ministry | VP Infra / SRE | DevOps, infrastructure |
| 吏部 Personnel Ministry | VP Product / PMO | Project management, team coordination |
| 刑部 Justice Ministry | General Counsel | Legal compliance, contract review |

> 💡 Both projects are built on the same [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclawai/openclaw) framework with identical architecture — only the role names and cultural context differ. Pick the style you prefer!

```

Each agent is a standalone Discord Bot bound to its own AI identity:
- **Independent memory**: Every agent has its own `memory/` directory — the more you use it, the better it knows your projects
- **Independent models**: Use power models for heavy lifting, fast models for light work — save money without sacrificing quality
- **Sandboxed execution**: Agent code runs in isolation, no cross-contamination
- **Identity injection**: OpenClaw automatically assembles SOUL.md + IDENTITY.md + workspace files into the system prompt

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Description | Departments Involved |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| 🚀 **Solo Developer** | One person, complete tech team — coding + DevOps + marketing covered | 兵部 + 工部 + 礼部 |
| 🏫 **Student Learning** | AI tutor team — different subjects, different agents, each with memory | All Six customizable |

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: One-Line Deployment (5 minutes)

Grab a Linux server (ARM 4-core, 24 GB RAM recommended), SSH in, and run:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wanikua/boluobobo-ai-court-tutorial/main/install.sh)
```

The script automatically handles:
- ✅ System updates + cloud provider firewall configuration
- ✅ 4 GB Swap (prevents OOM kills)
- ✅ Node.js 22 + GitHub CLI + Chromium
- ✅ Global OpenClaw installation
- ✅ Workspace initialization (SOUL.md / IDENTITY.md / USER.md / openclaw.json multi-agent template)
- ✅ Gateway systemd service (auto-starts on boot)

The install script features color-coded output with progress indicators and ✓ success markers for each step.

> 💡 **Already have OpenClaw/Clawdbot installed?** Use the lite script — skips system dependencies, only initializes workspace and config templates:
> ```bash
> bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wanikua/boluobobo-ai-court-tutorial/main/install-lite.sh)
> ```
> Supports two modes: Discord multi-Bot mode or pure WebUI mode (no Discord needed).

> 🍎 **macOS user?** Use the Mac-specific script — installs all dependencies via Homebrew:
> ```bash
> bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wanikua/boluobobo-ai-court-tutorial/main/install-mac.sh)
> ```
> Supports both Intel and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4), auto-detects architecture.

### Step 2: Add Your Keys (10 minutes)

After the script finishes, you just need two things:

1. **LLM API Key** → From your LLM provider's dashboard
2. **Discord Bot Token** (one per department) → [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

```bash
# Edit config — fill in API Key and Bot Tokens
# Full install uses ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json; lite install uses ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json
nano ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json

# Start the court
systemctl --user start openclaw-gateway

# Verify
systemctl --user status openclaw-gateway
```

@mention your Bot in Discord and say something. If it replies, you're live.

### Step 3: Full Six Ministries + Automation (15 minutes)

```
@bingbu Write me a user login API
→ 兵部 bingbu (Power Model): Complete code + architecture suggestions, large tasks auto-spawn Threads

@hubu How much did we spend on APIs this month?
→ 户部 hubu (Power Model): Cost breakdown + optimization recommendations

@libu Write a Xiaohongshu post about AI tool recommendations
→ 礼部 libu (Fast Model): Copy + hashtag suggestions

@everyone Tomorrow's meeting at 3 PM — all departments prepare weekly reports
→ All agents acknowledge individually
```

Set up automated daily reports:
```bash
# Get the Gateway Token
openclaw gateway token

# Auto-generate daily report at 22:00 Beijing time
openclaw cron add \
  --name "Daily Report" --agent main \
  --cron "0 22 * * *" --tz "Asia/Shanghai" \
  --message "Generate today's daily report, write to Notion and post to Discord" \
  --session isolated --token <your-token>
```

## Court Architecture — The Three Departments and Six Ministries

### Historical Background

The Three Departments and Six Ministries (三省六部制) was the central government system of imperial China:
- **中书省 Zhongshu Province**: Drafting imperial edicts (= receiving user commands, generating plans)
- **门下省 Menxia Province**: Review and rejection (= message routing, permission verification)
- **尚书省 Shangshu Province**: Execution and implementation (= Skill tool layer, actual execution)

Under Shangshu Province were the **Six Ministries**, each managing its own domain. In this project, OpenClaw Gateway plays the role of the Three Departments, while six AI Agents correspond to the Six Ministries:

| Ministry | Historical Role | AI Role | Recommended Model | Typical Use Cases |
|----------|----------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **司礼监 silijian** — Chief Steward | Emperor's attendant, imperial review | Central coordination | Fast Model | Daily chat, task delegation, automated reporting |
| **兵部 bingbu** — War | Military affairs | Software engineering | Power Model | Coding, architecture design, code review, debugging |
| **户部 hubu** — Revenue | Census & taxation | Finance & operations | Power Model | Cost analysis, budgeting, e-commerce operations |
| **礼部 libu** — Rites | Ceremonies & diplomacy | Brand & marketing | Fast Model | Copywriting, social media, content strategy |
| **工部 gongbu** — Works | Engineering & construction | Infrastructure | Fast Model | DevOps, CI/CD, server management |
| **吏部 libu** — Personnel | Official selection | Project management | Fast Model | Startup incubation, task tracking, team coordination |
| **刑部 xingbu** — Justice | Law & punishment | Legal & compliance | Fast Model | Contract review, intellectual property, compliance checks |

> 💡 Model tiering strategy: Use power models for heavy tasks (coding/analysis), fast models for light tasks (copywriting/management) — saves roughly 5× on costs. You can also plug in economy models for further savings.

---

## Core Capabilities

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Collaboration
Each department is its own Bot. @mention one and it responds; @everyone triggers all of them. Large tasks automatically spawn Threads to keep channels tidy.
> ⚠️ To enable Bot-to-Bot interactions (e.g., word chain games, multi-Bot discussions), add `"allowBots": true` in the `channels.discord` section of `openclaw.json`. Without this, Bots ignore messages from other Bots by default. Each account also needs `"groupPolicy": "open"`, otherwise group messages will be silently dropped.

### 🧠 Independent Memory System
Each agent has its own workspace and `memory/` directory. Project knowledge accumulated through conversations is persisted to files and retained across sessions. The more you use an agent, the better it understands your project.

### 🛠️ 60+ Built-in Skills (Powered by OpenClaw Ecosystem)
It's not just a chatbot — the built-in toolset covers the entire development lifecycle, and you can extend with more Skills from [OpenClaw Hub](https://github.com/openclawai/openclaw):

| Category | Skills |
|----------|--------|
| Development | GitHub (Issues/PRs/CI), Coding Agent |
| Documentation | Notion (databases/pages/automated reporting) |
| Information | Browser automation, Web search, Web scraping |
| Automation | Cron scheduled tasks, Heartbeat self-checks |
| Media | TTS voice, Screenshots, Video frame extraction |
| Operations | tmux remote control, Shell command execution |
| Communication | Discord, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal… |
| Extensions | OpenClaw Hub community Skills, Custom Skills |

### ⏰ Scheduled Tasks (Cron)
Built-in Cron scheduler lets agents run tasks on autopilot:
- Auto-generate daily reports, post to Discord + save to Notion
- Weekly summary roll-ups
- Scheduled health checks and code backups
- Any custom recurring task you can think of

### 👥 Team Collaboration
Invite friends to your Discord server — everyone can @mention department Bots to issue commands. No interference between users, and results are visible to all.

### 🔒 Sandbox Isolation
Agents can run inside Docker sandboxes with isolated code execution. Supports configurable isolation levels for networking, filesystem, and environment variables.

---

## 🖥️ GUI Management Interface

Beyond Discord command-line interaction, the AI Court also offers multiple graphical interface (GUI) management options:

### Web Dashboard (Boluo Dynasty Dashboard)

This project includes a built-in Web management dashboard (in the `gui/` directory), built with React + TypeScript + Vite, providing:

- **📊 Dashboard**: Real-time view of department status, token consumption, system load
- **💬 Court Hall**: Chat directly with department Bots from the web interface
- **📋 Session Management**: Browse all historical sessions, message details, token stats
- **⏰ Cron Jobs**: Visual management of scheduled tasks (enable/disable/manual trigger)
- **📈 Token Analytics**: Token consumption breakdown by department and date
- **🔧 System Health**: CPU/memory/disk monitoring, Gateway status

**How to start:**
```bash
# Build the frontend
cd gui && npm install && npm run build

# Start the backend API server (default port 18790)
cd server && npm install && node index.js
```

Access at: `http://your-server-ip:18790`

> 💡 For production, use Nginx reverse proxy + HTTPS instead of exposing the port directly.

### Discord as GUI

Discord itself is the best GUI management interface:
- **Phone + Desktop** sync — manage from anywhere
- **Channel categories** naturally map to departments (兵部, 户部, 礼部…)
- **Message history** permanently saved with built-in search
- **Permission management** with fine-grained control over who sees and does what
- **@mention** any agent to invoke it — zero learning curve

### Notion as Data Visualization

Through OpenClaw's Notion Skill integration, court data auto-syncs to Notion:
- **Daily Reports** and **Weekly Summaries** auto-generated
- **Finance Tracking** automatically records API consumption
- **Project Archives** track progress across all projects
- Notion's kanban, calendar, and table views provide rich data visualization

> 💡 Three-tier GUI: **Web Dashboard** for system status → **Discord** for issuing commands → **Notion** for reports and historical data.

## FAQ

### Basics

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
No. The one-line install script handles setup, and configuration is just filling in a few keys. All interaction happens through natural language in Discord.

**Q: How is this different from just using ChatGPT?**
ChatGPT is a single generalist that forgets everything when you close the tab. This system gives you multiple specialists — each agent has its own domain expertise, persistent memory, and tool permissions. They can automatically commit code to GitHub, write docs to Notion, and run tasks on a schedule.

**Q: Can I use other models?**
Yes. OpenClaw supports Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and any other provider compatible with the OpenAI API format. Just change the model config in `openclaw.json`. Different departments can use different models.

**Q: How much does the API cost per month?**
Depends on usage intensity. Light usage: $10–15/month, moderate: $20–30/month. Cost-saving tip: use power models for heavy tasks, fast models for light tasks (roughly 5× cheaper), and plug in economy models for simple tasks to save even more.

**Q: What's the relationship with Become CEO?**
[Become CEO](https://github.com/wanikua/become-ceo) is the English corporate edition of this project, using the same OpenClaw framework and architecture but with modern corporate roles (CTO, CFO, etc.) instead of imperial court titles. Prefer ancient Chinese aesthetics? Choose AI Court. Prefer modern corporate style? Choose Become CEO.

### Technical

**Q: @everyone doesn't trigger agent responses?**
In the Discord Developer Portal, each Bot needs **Message Content Intent** and **Server Members Intent** enabled. The Bot's role in the server also needs View Channels permission. OpenClaw treats @everyone as an explicit mention for every Bot — once permissions are set correctly, it will trigger responses.

**Q: Agent reports permission errors after enabling sandbox?**
Sandbox mode set to `all` runs the agent inside a Docker container with a read-only filesystem, no network access, and no inherited environment variables by default. Fix:

```json
"sandbox": {
  "mode": "all",
  "workspaceAccess": "rw",
  "docker": {
    "network": "bridge",
    "env": { "LLM_API_KEY": "your-LLM-API-KEY" }
  }
}
```
- `workspaceAccess: "rw"` — Allows the sandbox to read/write the working directory
- `docker.network: "bridge"` — Enables network access
- `docker.env` — Passes in API keys (sandbox doesn't inherit host environment variables)

**Q: Will multiple users @mentioning the same agent cause conflicts?**
No. OpenClaw maintains independent sessions for each user × agent combination. Multiple people can @mention 兵部 bingbu simultaneously — their conversations won't interfere with each other.

**Q: Can agents call each other?**
Yes. Agents can use `sessions_spawn` to delegate sub-tasks to other agents, or `sessions_send` to message another agent's session. For example, 司礼监 (Chief Steward) can assign coding tasks to 兵部 bingbu.

**Q: How do I create custom Skills?**
OpenClaw has a built-in Skill Creator tool for creating custom Skills. Each Skill is a directory containing `SKILL.md` (instructions) + scripts + resources. Place it in the `skills/` directory of your workspace, and agents can use it immediately. You can also find community-shared Skills on [OpenClaw Hub](https://github.com/openclawai/openclaw).

**Q: How do I connect private models (Ollama, etc.)?**
Add an OpenAI API-compatible provider in the `models.providers` section of `openclaw.json`, pointing `baseUrl` to your Ollama address. Local Ollama models have zero API costs.

**Q: How do I troubleshoot Gateway startup failures?**
```bash
# Check detailed logs
journalctl --user -u openclaw-gateway --since today --no-pager

# Run diagnostics
openclaw doctor

# Common causes: missing API Key, malformed JSON, invalid Bot Token
```
