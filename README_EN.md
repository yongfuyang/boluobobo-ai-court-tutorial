## 📜 What Is This?

**AI Court** is a ready-to-use multi-AI-agent collaboration system that maps China's ancient **Three Departments and Six Ministries** (中书省 Zhongshu · 门下省 Menxia · 尚书省 Shangshu → 吏部 Personnel · 户部 Revenue · 礼部 Rites · 兵部 War · 刑部 Justice · 工部 Works) onto a modern AI agent organization.

**In plain terms:** You are the Emperor 👑, and AI agents are your ministers. Each minister has a clear role — one writes code, one manages finances, one handles marketing, one runs DevOps — all you do is issue an "imperial decree" (@mention an agent in Discord), and they execute immediately.

### 🤔 Why an Ancient Court Architecture?

The Three Departments and Six Ministries system was one of the longest-running organizational frameworks in human history (Sui/Tang to Qing dynasty, over 1,300 years). Its core design principles:

- **🏛️ Clear Separation of Duties** — Each ministry handles its own domain, no overstepping (= each AI Agent has its specialty)
- **📋 Standardized Processes** — Memorial submission and imperial review systems (= Prompt templates + SOUL.md persona injection)
- **🔄 Checks and Balances** — Three Departments cross-verify (= Agent cross-review, multi-step confirmation)
- **📜 Record Keeping** — Court diaries and historical records (= Memory persistence, Notion auto-archival)

These concepts map perfectly to modern multi-agent system design needs. **Ancient governance wisdom is the best practice for modern AI team management.**

### 🎯 Core Capabilities at a Glance

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🤖 **Multi-Agent Collaboration** | 18+ independent AI Agents, each specialized, working in concert |
| 🧠 **Independent Memory** | Each agent has its own workspace and memory files — the more you use it, the better it knows you |
| 🛠️ **60+ Built-in Skills** | GitHub, Notion, Browser, Cron, TTS and more, ready out of the box |
| ⏰ **Automated Tasks** | Cron scheduling + heartbeat self-checks, 24/7 unattended operation |
| 🔒 **Sandbox Isolation** | Docker container isolation, agent code runs independently |
| 💬 **Multi-Platform** | Discord / Feishu (Lark) / Slack / Telegram / Pure WebUI |
| 🖥️ **Web Dashboard** | React + TypeScript dashboard for visual management |
| 🌐 **OpenClaw Ecosystem** | Built on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), access the [OpenClaw Hub](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) Skill ecosystem |

> 📖 **Deep dive** → [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md)

### 🏢 Prefer a Corporate Edition?

If you're more familiar with modern corporate management concepts, we have an **English corporate version**:

👉 **[Become CEO](https://github.com/wanikua/become-ceo)** — Same architecture, using CEO / CTO / CFO / CMO roles instead of imperial ministries

| 🏛️ Court Role | 🏢 Corporate Role | Responsibility |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Emperor 👑 | CEO | Ultimate decision maker |
| 司礼监 Chief Steward | COO | Daily coordination, task delegation |
| 兵部 War Ministry | CTO / VP Engineering | Software engineering, architecture |
| 户部 Revenue Ministry | CFO / VP Finance | Financial analysis, cost management |
| 礼部 Rites Ministry | CMO / VP Marketing | Brand marketing, content strategy |
| 工部 Works Ministry | VP Infra / SRE | DevOps, infrastructure |
| 吏部 Personnel Ministry | VP Product / PMO | Project management, team coordination |
| 刑部 Justice Ministry | General Counsel | Legal compliance, contract review |

> 💡 Both projects are built on the same [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) framework with identical architecture — only the role names and cultural context differ. Pick the style you prefer!

> 📌 **About Originality** — This project was first committed on **2025-02-22** ([commit history](https://github.com/wanikua/danghuangshang/commits/main)) and represents the original implementation of the concept "modeling AI multi-agent collaboration after China's imperial court system." We noticed that [cft0808/edict](https://github.com/cft0808/edict) (first committed 2025-02-23, approximately 21 hours later) shares striking similarities with this project in framework selection, SOUL.md persona files, install.sh deployment approach, and competitor comparison tables — see [Issue #55](https://github.com/cft0808/edict/issues/55) for details.

Each agent is a standalone Discord Bot bound to its own AI identity:
- **Independent memory**: Every agent has its own `memory/` directory — the more you use it, the better it knows your projects
- **Independent models**: Use power models for heavy lifting, fast models for light work — save money without sacrificing quality
- **Sandboxed execution**: Agent code runs in isolation, no cross-contamination
- **Identity injection**: OpenClaw automatically assembles SOUL.md + IDENTITY.md + workspace files into the system prompt

## Quick Start (Three Steps to the Throne)

> 🔴 **Beginners: use a cloud server, not your personal computer.** See [Security Guide](./docs/security.md).

### 📍 Step 0: Already Have OpenClaw?

> Already running OpenClaw? No need to reinstall. Use the lite script to initialize the court workspace and config template:
> ```bash
> bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wanikua/danghuangshang/main/install-lite.sh)
> ```
> Then skip to Step 3 to fill in your keys. **New users: ignore this, start from Step 1.**

### 📍 Step 1: Got a Server?

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| ✅ Have a Linux server | Go to Step 2 |
| ✅ Have a Mac | Go to Step 2 |
| ❌ No server | → [**Get a free server**](./docs/server-setup.md) (Oracle Cloud: free 4-core 24GB) |

### 📍 Step 2: Choose Your Platform

| Path | Platform | Best For | Deploy Method | Docs |
|:---:|----------|----------|---------------|------|
| **A** | Discord | Global users / Beginners | Linux one-line script | [→ Path A](./docs/setup-linux-discord.md) |
| **B** | Any | Docker experienced | Docker container | [→ Path B](./docs/setup-docker.md) |
| **C** | Any | Mac users | macOS Homebrew | [→ Path C](./docs/setup-macos.md) |
| **D** | Feishu (Lark) | China users | Linux one-line script | [→ Path D](./docs/setup-feishu.md) |
| **E** | Pure WebUI | No Bot needed | Just API Key | [→ Path E](./docs/setup-webui.md) |
| **W** | Any | Windows users | WSL2 | [→ WSL2 Guide](./docs/windows-wsl.md) |

> 💡 **Not sure?** China users → **D** (Feishu). Global users → **A** (Discord).

### 📍 Step 3: Install → Add Keys → Start

```bash
# 1️⃣ One-line install (Linux example)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wanikua/danghuangshang/main/install.sh)

# 2️⃣ Add API Key and Bot Token
nano ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json

# 3️⃣ Start
systemctl --user start openclaw-gateway
```

@mention your Bot, get a reply = you're on the throne! 🎉

### Hanlin Academy OpenViking Integration

OpenViking is now an **optional plugin** for enhanced 3D persistent memory. The default memory system is file-based, provided by the `novel-memory` skill. To install OpenViking as an optional upgrade:

```bash
openclaw plugins install ./extensions/novel-openviking
```

Once installed, OpenViking provides the following MCP server modules:

| OpenViking Module | Function | Use Case |
|------------------|----------|----------|
| Memories | Static knowledge + dynamic logs | Chapter summaries, character states, foreshadowing tracking |
| Resources | Reference material library | Reference novels, style samples |
| Skills | Structured knowledge graph | Character relationships, world settings |

> Without the OpenViking plugin, all memory operations use the built-in file-based `novel-memory` skill, which stores data in the agent's `memory/` directory. OpenViking is recommended for large-scale novels (100+ chapters) where structured graph queries become beneficial.

---

## Core Capabilities

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Collaboration
Each department is its own Bot. @mention one and it responds; @everyone triggers all of them. Large tasks automatically spawn Threads to keep channels tidy.
> ⚠️ To enable Bot-to-Bot interactions (e.g., word chain games, multi-Bot discussions), add `"allowBots": "mentions"` in the `channels.discord` section of `openclaw.json`. This ensures Bots only respond when @mentioned by other Bots, preventing infinite reply loops. Without this, Bots ignore messages from other Bots by default. Each account also needs `"groupPolicy": "open"`, otherwise group messages will be silently dropped.

### 🧠 Independent Memory System
Each agent has its own workspace and `memory/` directory. Project knowledge accumulated through conversations is persisted to files and retained across sessions. The more you use an agent, the better it understands your project.

### 🛠️ 60+ Built-in Skills (Powered by OpenClaw Ecosystem)
It's not just a chatbot — the built-in toolset covers the entire development lifecycle, and you can extend with more Skills from [OpenClaw Hub](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw):

| Category | Skills |
|----------|--------|
| Development | GitHub (Issues/PRs/CI), Coding Agent |
| Documentation | Notion (databases/pages/automated reporting) |
| Information | Browser automation, Web search, Web scraping |
| Automation | Cron scheduled tasks, Heartbeat self-checks |
| Media | TTS voice, Screenshots, Video frame extraction |
| Operations | tmux remote control, Shell command execution |
| Communication | Discord, Slack, Lark (Feishu), Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal… |
| Extensions | OpenClaw Hub community Skills, Custom Skills |

### ⏰ Scheduled Tasks (Cron)
Built-in Cron scheduler lets agents run tasks on autopilot:
- Auto-generate daily reports, post to Discord + save to Notion
- Weekly summary roll-ups
- Scheduled health checks and code backups
- Any custom recurring task you can think of

### 👥 Team Collaboration
Invite friends to your Discord server — everyone can @mention department Bots to issue commands. No interference between users, and results are visible to all.

### 🔒 Sandbox Isolation
Agents can run inside Docker sandboxes with isolated code execution. Supports configurable isolation levels for networking, filesystem, and environment variables.

---

## 🖥️ GUI Management Interface

Beyond Discord command-line interaction, the AI Court also offers multiple graphical interface (GUI) management options:

### Web Dashboard (Boluo Dynasty Dashboard)

This project includes a built-in Web management dashboard (in the `gui/` directory), built with React + TypeScript + Vite:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/gui-court.png" alt="Court Overview — all departments at a glance" width="90%" />
  <br/>
  <em>Court Overview — Throne, Six Ministries, and Auxiliary Offices with live status</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/gui-sessions.png" alt="Session Management — token consumption and message stats" width="90%" />
  <br/>
  <em>Session Management — 88 sessions, 9008 messages, 87.34M tokens tracked in real-time</em>
</p>

Features include:
- **Dashboard**: Real-time view of department status, token consumption, system load
- **Court Hall**: Chat directly with department Bots from the web interface
- **Session Management**: Browse all historical sessions, message details, token stats
- **Cron Jobs**: Visual management of scheduled tasks (enable/disable/manual trigger)
- **Token Analytics**: Token consumption breakdown by department and date
- **System Health**: CPU/memory/disk monitoring, Gateway status

**How to start:**
```bash
# Build the frontend
cd gui && npm install && npm run build

# Start the backend API server (default port 18795)
cd server && npm install && node index.js
```

Access at: `http://your-server-ip:18795`

> 💡 For production, use Nginx reverse proxy + HTTPS instead of exposing the port directly.

### Discord as GUI

Discord itself is the best GUI management interface:
- **Phone + Desktop** sync — manage from anywhere
- **Channel categories** naturally map to departments (兵部, 户部, 礼部…)
- **Message history** permanently saved with built-in search
- **Permission management** with fine-grained control over who sees and does what
- **@mention** any agent to invoke it — zero learning curve

### Notion as Data Visualization

Through OpenClaw's Notion Skill integration, court data auto-syncs to Notion:
- **Daily Reports** and **Weekly Summaries** auto-generated
- **Finance Tracking** automatically records API consumption
- **Project Archives** track progress across all projects
- Notion's kanban, calendar, and table views provide rich data visualization

> 💡 Three-tier GUI: **Web Dashboard** for system status → **Discord** for issuing commands → **Notion** for reports and historical data.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
→ No. One-line script installs everything. Natural language interaction in Discord.

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?**
→ ChatGPT = one generalist, forgets everything. This = multiple specialists with persistent memory, tools, and automation.

**Q: Can I use other models?**
→ Yes. OpenClaw supports Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and any OpenAI API-compatible provider. Different departments can use different models.

**Q: Monthly API cost?**
→ Light: $10-15. Moderate: $20-30. Use power models for heavy tasks, fast models for light tasks (5× savings).

**Q: What's the relationship with Become CEO?**
→ Same OpenClaw framework and architecture, but with modern corporate roles (CTO, CFO, etc.) instead of imperial court titles.

**Q: @everyone doesn't trigger responses?**
→ Enable Message Content Intent + Server Members Intent for each Bot. See [Diagnostics](./docs/doctor.md).

**Q: Agent reports permission errors after enabling sandbox?**
→ Sandbox mode `all` uses a Docker container with restricted defaults. Set `workspaceAccess: "rw"`, `docker.network: "bridge"`, and pass API keys via `docker.env`.

**Q: Will multiple users @mentioning the same agent cause conflicts?**
→ No. OpenClaw maintains independent sessions per user × agent combination.

**Q: Can agents call each other?**
→ Yes. Use `sessions_spawn` to delegate sub-tasks or `sessions_send` to message another agent's session.

**Q: How do I create custom Skills?**
→ Each Skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` + scripts. Place it in `skills/` and agents can use it immediately. Community Skills available on [OpenClaw Hub](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw).

**Q: How do I connect private models (Ollama, etc.)?**
→ Add an OpenAI API-compatible provider in `models.providers` of `openclaw.json`, pointing `baseUrl` to your Ollama address.

**Q: How do I troubleshoot Gateway startup failures?**
→ Run `journalctl --user -u openclaw-gateway --since today --no-pager` or `openclaw doctor`. Common causes: missing API Key, malformed JSON, invalid Bot Token.
